**Simple Responsive Website**
Overview
This project is a simple website built using HTML and CSS. While the concept is basic, the primary goal was to learn how to make the website responsive across various screen sizes. The project allowed me to experiment with media queries and flexbox to ensure the design adapts seamlessly to different devices.

**Technologies Used**
- HTML
- CSS

**Key Learnings**
- Responsive Design: Implemented media queries to ensure the website adjusts to different screen sizes, from desktop to mobile.
- Flexbox: Utilized flexbox to create a fluid and flexible layout.
- Best Practices: Gained a deeper understanding of organizing and structuring CSS for scalability.

**Future Improvements**
- Add more interactivity with JavaScript.
- Implement more advanced CSS techniques (e.g., animations).
- Expand the project with additional pages.
